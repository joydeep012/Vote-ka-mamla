## 📘 Project Description

In traditional voting systems, votes are managed by centralized authorities, which can lead to bias or manipulation.  
**Vote Ka Mamla** solves this by allowing anyone to **deploy and manage elections** directly on the **Celo blockchain** — ensuring fairness, transparency, and security.

This project runs on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**, making it perfect for testing and learning.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- The **contract owner** (the deployer) can add candidates.  
- Each **voter** can cast **only one vote**.  
- The votes are **recorded permanently** on the blockchain.  
- Anyone can **view vote counts** for each candidate.
